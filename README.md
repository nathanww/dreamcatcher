DreamCatcher project for automated TMR using Fitbit and EEG

This is a project by the Paller lab to develop systems for automatic targeted memory reactivation in home settings. Currently it comprises:

* A Fitbit app for acquiring and transmitting heart rate and motion data
* An Android app for acquiring EEG from a portable device (HypnoDyne zMax) and using EEG/Fitbit data to control TMR
* A server for easily connecting components and streaming data to a remote location
